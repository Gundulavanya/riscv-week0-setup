🚀 Chip Design Step-by-Step Journey

Welcome to my documentation of the chip design process — from abstract specs all the way to silicon tapeout!

This repository walks through each stage of chip design, keeping things structured and clear for learners and enthusiasts.

"In this journey, we learn how an idea becomes silicon — from C-model specifications to RTL, synthesis, and final GDSII — using open-source tools and industry practices."

📝 Design Flow Overview

Specs (C Model) → RTL → Synthesis & Integration → Physical Design → Tapeout

📅 Stage 0 — Specs & Modeling (O1)

Foundation Stage: Writing the Blueprint

Build a C model describing the chip’s functionality.

Verification with C-language testbenches.

Defines the golden reference for all later stages.

👨‍💻 Think of this as the architect’s sketch of the future chip.

📅 Stage 1 — RTL Design (O2)

From Idea to Hardware Representation

Create Verilog RTL from the C specs.

Write, simulate, and verify RTL.

Define the soft hardware copy.

📝 This is where abstract logic becomes structured design.

📅 Stage 2 — Synthesis & Integration (O3)

Bringing It All Together

Synthesize RTL into a gate-level netlist.

Integrate processors, peripherals/IPs, macros, and analog IPs.

Perform SoC-level verification.

🔗 The design now resembles a complete system.

📅 Stage 3 — Tapeout & Verification (O4)

Final Lap Before Silicon

Physical design steps: floorplanning, placement, routing.

Generate the GDSII file for fabrication.

Verify that O1 = O2 = O3 = O4 for consistency.

🏭 The blueprint becomes real silicon!

🛠️ Tools for Getting Started

VirtualBox → Linux environment setup 🖥️

Yosys → RTL synthesis 🔧

GTKWave → Simulation waveform viewer 📊

These open-source tools enable simulation, synthesis, and verification at every stage.

🙏 Acknowledgment

Special thanks to the open-source chip design community for building the tools and knowledge base that make this journey possible.
